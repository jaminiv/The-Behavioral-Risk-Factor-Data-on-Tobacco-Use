# <h1 style="font-size: 80px;">Tobacco Addiction Analysis: Behavioral Risk Factor Data</h1> 

**Introduction**

This project explores the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to analyze patterns and factors associated with tobacco addiction. Tobacco use remains one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, contributing to serious health issues such as lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory disorders. By examining the behavioral, demographic, and health-related factors that influence tobacco addiction, this project aims to provide actionable insights to inform public health policies and interventions.

**Objectives**

The primary goals of this project are:

Analyze Behavioral Trends: Understand the behavioral and demographic characteristics of smokers versus non-smokers.

Identify Risk Factors: Pinpoint key predictors of tobacco addiction using statistical and machine learning techniques.

Model Smoking Behavior: Build predictive models to classify individuals based on their likelihood of tobacco use.

Support Public Health Strategies: Provide insights to guide targeted interventions aimed at reducing tobacco addiction.
Methodology

**The project follows a structured data science pipeline:**

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
Normalize and encode categorical variables for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize patterns and trends in tobacco use across demographic groups.
Examine correlations between behavioral factors and smoking status.

Feature Engineering:
Select and engineer relevant features for predictive modeling.

Machine Learning Models:
Train and evaluate classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Compare models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights and Recommendations:
Derive actionable insights from the findings to support public health policies.
Key Findings

Demographic Insights:
Smoking prevalence is higher among specific age groups, income levels, and education levels.
Gender and geographic location significantly influence smoking behavior.

Behavioral Predictors:
Behavioral factors such as alcohol consumption, physical activity, and mental health are closely associated with tobacco use.

Model Performance:
The Random Forest model outperformed other models with high accuracy and F1-score, making it the best choice for predicting smoking behavior.

Public Health Implications:
Targeted campaigns focusing on at-risk groups can be more effective in reducing tobacco addiction.
Behavioral interventions, such as promoting healthier lifestyles and mental health support, can complement anti-smoking efforts.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing tobacco addiction. By analyzing behavioral risk factors and leveraging machine learning models, we provide valuable insights to policymakers and healthcare professionals. These findings can help design targeted interventions to reduce smoking rates and improve public health outcomes.
